# Custom Data Migration Script

## What this does

Makes a connection to the mysql database running a remote server (in the developer's initial case - on the Yapeen Farm Raspberry Pi), and copy data from the solar and data tables into a Postgres db running on a laptop.

## How to Run

In a command prompt, change to the folder and type

`node copyData.js`
